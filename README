Project Description:
=====================

With the developing field of robotics, many researches are going on to make robots more human like. One of the challenging quests is to make robots write like humans. This is what our project is all about. We are programing a SPARK robot to write on a piece of paper. Characters are input using keyboard and the robot writes on a piece of paper using a self developed mechanism.
